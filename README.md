# 2nd Deliverable-Design Process
----
## 3 Step Iterative Process 

### 1st Iteraion
---- 

#### Step1: Review Inputs 

#### Step2: Establish iteration goal by selecting drivers
Goal|Defining the structure of the System |
--|--

#### Step3: Choose one of more elements of the system to decompose
#### Step4: Choose one or more design concepts that satisfy the selected driver
#### Step5: Instantiate architecural elements, allocate responsiblites and define interfaces
#### Step6: Sketch views and record design decisions
#### Step7: Perform analysis of current design and review iteration goal and design objectives 


### 2nd Iteration
----

#### Step2: Establish iteration goal by selecting drivers
Goal|Defining the components of the architecture to achieve the functional requirements of the system|
--|--

#### Step3: Choose one of more elements of the system to decompose
#### Step4: Choose one or more design concepts that satisfy the selected driver
#### Step5: Instantiate architecural elements, allocate responsiblites and define interfaces
#### Step6: Sketch views and record design decisions
#### Step7: Perform analysis of current design and review iteration goal and design objectives 

### 3rd Iteration
---- 


#### Step2: Establish iteration goal by selecting drivers
Goal|Refactoring the architecture to achieve the quality requirements of the system|
--|--

#### Step3: Choose one of more elements of the system to decompose
#### Step4: Choose one or more design concepts that satisfy the selected driver
#### Step5: Instantiate architecural elements, allocate responsiblites and define interfaces
#### Step6: Sketch views and record design decisions
#### Step7: Perform analysis of current design and review iteration goal and design objectives
