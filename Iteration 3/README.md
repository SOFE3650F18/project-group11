# Iteration 3

#### Step2: Establish iteration goal by selecting drivers
Goal|Refactoring the architecture to achieve the quality requirements of the system|
--|--

### Address Quality Attributes, Use Case, Concerns and Constrains not satisfied in previous iteration
---
A failure occurs in the course management system during operation. The system deals with the crash within 4 hours.

Messaging System

#### Step3: Choose one of more elements of the system to decompose
* Application Server
* Database Server
#### Step4: Choose one or more design concepts that satisfy the selected driver
Design Decision| Rational|
-|-
Introduce active redundancy by replicating the application server and other critical components such as the databases|By replicating the critical components, the system can withstand the failure of one of the replicated elements without affecting functionality.
Allow DBMS to perform regular maintained to minimize downtime| Using a database that has this functionality can drastically improve application performance|
Introduce push notification using cloud based server| Allows for multiple user message handling|
USE AWS Server|Easy to administer **[QA-14]**, Highly Scalable **[QA-9][CRN-9][CON-2][CON-4]**, Available and Durable **[CRN-8],[CON-1]**, Fast, Secure **[CRN-11]** Allows you to schedule automatic backup **[UC-17]**
USE Google Cloud Messaging to engage user|Allows application developers to send notification data or information from Client-Side servers|

#### Step5: Instantiate architectural elements, allocate responsibilities and define interfaces
Element|Responsibility |
-|-
Push Connector|Distribute messages to your client app in any of three ways to single devices, to groups of devices, or to devices subscribed to topics.|


Element|Responsibility|
-|-
Node/Express Sever|Allows for communication with cloud server for messaging and push notification as well as data transfer to client side|
AWS Database Server| Allows for database maintenance and communication with the low level data|

#### Step6: Sketch views and record design decisions

UC-4 Search Courses<br/>
The diagram below is an initial sequence diagram for UC-4 (Search courses). The interaction starts with a student launching the program from the student view, and searching for courses. The request of the searched courses is sent from the client to the server. The Server Configuration controller first sets up a connection with the DBMS. If a connection is successfully established,the Data Collection Controller queries the DBMS, and returns the result to the client. However, if a connection is not established successfully, then an error is returned to the client.

#### Step7: Perform analysis of current design and review iteration goal and design objectives
